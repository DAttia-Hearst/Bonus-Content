This is the script from the last Monitoring Webcast https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec9Fy6CpjTw. This script assumes your influx and PDQ are on the same server. If it needs to run against a remote machine line 18 weill need to be modified slightly to rung it against a remote machine.

In the webcast we covered how to find the PsScanID, you can either look it up with a dbbrowser like dbbrowser. Or you can export the scanner you are using and the ID, in the xml it will look lik <UID>4b7660665c7d4317ba40cf31d649c283</UID>.

Params:

DBPath - This is where your Inventory database is located.

Server - The irl of your influx location. If you did not change any defaults it is "http://localhost:8086"

Token - Influx token for the user. It is Located in Data > Tokens

Originisation - Name of your org in Influx DB

Bucket - Bucket you want to import the data into

PsScanID - UID of PowerShell scanner you are querying.
