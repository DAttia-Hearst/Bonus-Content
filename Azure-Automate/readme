This is some of the code that I used for being able to automate new user creation in Azure even if 2fa is on.

Creating the ap registration is done on the azure side, I have a video covering how I did that part, this is mostly the PowerShell that I used

This PowerShell uses a lot of the secrets module, for more information on setting that up see that fantastic blog written by Andrewe Pla
https://www.pdq.com/blog/how-to-manage-powershell-secrets-with-secretsmanagement/

The connection string to not need to use 2fa will require 
1. tenantID you are connecting to
2. The AppID from app registration in Azure
3. Cert Thumbprint you set up for authentication

I put each one of those pieces of information into my secrets vault


This is not a do all for user creation, this is just a test case of being able to automate the process even when 2fa is in place. You can do so much more with graph when
creating user. Feel free to add to this and make your automation masterpiece.
