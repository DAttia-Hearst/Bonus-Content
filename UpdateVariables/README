Instructions
1. Variable names must be consistent between the products
2. Export the variable from the up to date product to anywhere, I have them in temp, but where ever you need them would be fine, just update the script
3. Run ps1, it will grab the xml and use it to make your variables the same accross the board.


Description
This is a rough draft of importing variable from one PDQ product to another. The script as is assumes you exported from inventory and will be updating deploy, changing line 4 
from pdqdeploy to pdqinventory will swithc that over.
